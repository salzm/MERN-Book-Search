## Description

This project was to demonstrate to the use of the MERN Stack

## Usage

This had starter code and I needed to clone and then get started. I linked it to heroku and then deployed it and got an application error. From there, I need to amake sure the Apollo server was working. Trying to work out why the application error is showing.
